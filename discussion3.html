                        Some of the top selling app categories in the United States are games, news, maps and social media. Some of the top selling
                        app categories in Japan are games, productivity, utilities and tools such as photo editing applications. A few of the top selling
                        categories in the United Kingdom are games, email, travel apps and social media. Based on the categories of applications predominately used in
                        each region I could assume that game development and utility tools like maps, travel apps and email will be successful in all three of the markets.
                        While social media might vie well in the U.S and U.K but productivity & tool applications would be better for the Japanese market. 
                        The percentage of smartphones with the Android OS in the United States is 47%. In Japan it increase to 60% and rounds off at 36.6% for the United Kingdom.
                        The Android site lists the latest OS as Jelly Bean and it has a 0.8% penetration. The greatest OS in circulation is Gingerbread and it holds a 60.6% of Android systems.
                        These rates impact the development cycle because we as developers can utilize this data to target regions best for deploying Android applications. Based on the data Japan
                        would be nearly twice as good for Android development than the U.K. </br>
                        The average cost of bandwidth varies from region to region but the bandwidth limits seem to be nearly the same. In the United States, the average cost of bandwidth is $1.10
                        per megabit per second (Mbps. This price is relatively high compared to many other developed nations. For instance, in the United Kingdom the average cost of bandwidth is
                        $0.61/Mbps and in Japan the average cost of bandwidth per megabit per second is only $0.06. The caps for these three countries are pretty uniform as well with some
                        slight differences. In the United States the caps range from 2Gb (gigabytes) to 4Gb a month. This is similar in Japan where their bandwidth caps are from 5Gb to
                        7Gb. In the U.K the caps are broader ranging from 250Mb (megabytes) to 3Gb. The bandwidth speeds for the U.S, Japan, and U.K are 5.8Mbps, 9.1Mbps, and 4.9Mbps respectively.
                        It's interesting to note that the fastest connection is in South Korea with 17.5Mbps. The data on bandwidth caps and cost impact development by highlighting areas where
                        bandwidth heavy applications may be best deployed relative to the cost of such usage. It may also show that the populace may be more inclined to use such data driven apps
                        without hesitation.</br>
                        If I were to be actively developing and deploying Android based applications I would target the U.S and Japan. I would target the U.S market first because of the greater
                        number of Android devices and Japan would follow. I would also need to take into account of which application I would be deploying as utilities and tools would fare better
                        in the Japanese market.
