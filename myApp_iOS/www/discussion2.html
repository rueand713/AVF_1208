                        Accessibility is important in facilitating a means for disabled persons to utilize a piece of equipment or even
                        in completing some day-to-day activities. Many things have been made to be more accessible for these reasons.
                        There are several devices made for just this purpose that revolve around computers and computer software.
                        A computer can also be the device for accessibility in itself. For instance many operating systems come with voice technology.
                        One example is Apple's screen access software called VoiceOver, which comes bundled with Mac OS X. The main feature is the text-to-speech
                        but it also features gesture control and a feature called &quot;type-to-select&quot; used to select menu items by typing the name instead of having
                        to navigate the mouse and click the tab. Another more common device used for accessibility on computers is the large print keyboard.
                        This type of keyboard is designed to assist users with visual disabilities like low vision. They usually feature keyboard keys that are a
                        few times larger than normal keyboard keys and a use of high contrast color to cue important keys or for displaying the key print.
                        There are also several apps that are used for accessing mobile devices. Two of which are for the Android operating system.
                        The first is part of a suite of apps developed by Google called TalkBack. It is used to assist visually impaired users by
                        providing spoken feedback. Another app is called Mobile Accessibility and is developed by a company called Code Factory.
                        This application is also designed to assist blind or visually impaired users.<br>
                        After watching the video on the JAWS screen reader I was a little skeptical on how it actually helped anyone. Some problems
                        I had with this device was the awkward keyboard usage. It requires the user to remember all sorts of key combinations to shortcut tasks.
                        I think this just frustrates any idea of accessibility by itself. Another thing that frustrated me was the speech synthesizer.
                        The program costs nearly a thousand dollars and it just garbles everything out all at once and then requires to user to use one of those weird
                        key combinations in order to stop the playing or restart it. I think this screen reader could become more intuitive by providing a simpler means
                        of navigation. Voice input for example could be used for those who can speak and providing an assisting device like a keypad with braille
                        that is mapped to the program functions for those who maybe can't speak or see.<br>
                        We can change our HTML to be more accessible by using good semantic markup. Additionally by providing good descriptive values to the
                        anchors and image &quot;ALT&quot; properties we can assist those who are using screen-reading technologies.
