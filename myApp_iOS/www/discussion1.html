                        The types of features that we can implement with just the use of standard HTML, CSS,
                        and JavaScript are those features that are non-hardware related such as the web storage
                        and geo-location services. But with the use of the PhoneGap framework our web apps will be
                        able to access many native features. Those features include: the use of the Accelerometer,
                        the camera, compass, the contacts, local files, geo-location, local media, the phone network,
                        the notifications, and the phone's storage. The list is complete for iOS and Android but some
                        of the other phone platforms lack the capability to use all of the features that Android and iOS use.
                        I like to step out slowly into unfamiliar territory so I will make use of the easier features to start.
                        Such as the geo-location and notifications. Later I'm making plans to create a different app that will
                        be tailored to the use of a few of the others like the camera, media and files.
                        In the past I've learned to be proactive in my research and project implementation. I try to start early
                        to avoid any hassles and hiccups. Unfortunately this week my early start was slowed down due to OS
                        problems but had I procrastinated it may have been much worse. My current app is a fitness application
                        to keep track of a person's exercise routine but I can't think of any of these features besides storage
                        and notification that would fit well with this app. So I've been contemplating writing a few basic apps
                        that will be designed to use a few of those native features each. I really want to design something that
                        uses the camera and media features. My demo app is basically going to be kept as a launch pad for my other
                        apps. I may add a native feature to it but I'm not sure yet of what would make sense. Maybe access the
                        contacts and store my developer information in the phone.
